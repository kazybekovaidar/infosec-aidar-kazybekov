I used the following web-page to use different VIM commands and practiced with them.
https://vim.rtorr.com/
Global
:h[elp] keyword - open help for keyword
:sav[eas] file - save file as
:clo[se] - close current pane
:ter[minal] - open a terminal window
K - open man page for word under the cursor
Tip Run vimtutor in a terminal to learn the first Vim commands.
